## About me

I'm a developer interested in making web platforms and services.
By day I'm a Research Software Engineer at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk), a cross-disciplinary research group at Newcastle University.
I make technologies to support researcher projects ranging from [transport engagements](https://metrofutures.org.uk) through [geolocation based tools](https://make.place/spotter/) all the way to [global WhatsApp games](https://whatfutures.org/).

To make these projects happen I make use of a lot of technologies and methodologies.
I'm a keen test driven developer and agile worker and always like to try out different frameworks.
For instance this site uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) with a sprinkle of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
To host all my projects I use [Docker](https://docker.com) and I'm quite excited about [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) at the moment.

My latest projects are always on [GitHub](https://github.com/robb-j) and my latest ramblings are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Robbb_J).
