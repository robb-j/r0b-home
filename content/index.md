## About me

I'm a developer interested in making web platforms and services.
I'm a Senior Research Software Engineer at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/rob-anderson/),
a cross-disciplinary HCI research group at Newcastle University.
I make technologies for projects ranging from [virtual conference schedule's]({{ '/projects/deconf' | url }})
to [innovative platforms]({{ '/projects/not-equal-catalyst' | url }})
and even [global WhatsApp games]({{ '/projects/what-futures' | url }}).

I play with a lot of technologies and ideas.
I'm a keen test driven developer, agile worker and always like to try out different frameworks.
For instance I made this site with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/),
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
and a sprinkle of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
I'm big into devops, containerising things with [Docker](https://docker.com)
and have been quite liking [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) recently.

Most of my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/robb-j)
and my latest ramblings are on [Mastodon]({{ site.mastodon }}).
