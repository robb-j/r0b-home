## About me

I'm a developer interested in making web platforms and services.
I'm a Senior Research Software Engineer at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk),
a cross-disciplinary research group at Newcastle University.
I make technologies to support projects ranging from [virtual conference schedule's](https://climate-red.openlab.dev)
to [innovative platforms](https://catalyst.not-equal.tech/)
and even [global WhatsApp games](https://whatfutures.org/).

I make use of a lot of technologies and methodologies.
I'm a keen test driven developer, agile worker and always like to try out different frameworks.
For instance this site uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/)
and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
with a sprinkle of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
I deploy all my projects with [Docker](https://docker.com)
and am doing a lot with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) at the moment.

My latest projects are always on [GitHub](https://github.com/robb-j)
and my latest ramblings are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robbb_j).
